<h2>Coding Projects</h2>
<h5>Applications</h5>
<p>I am currently taking a class online on how to build an Android mobile App.
My ultimate goal would be to build an App that could benefit Morocco and North Africa in general.
I will be posting simple simulations of apps that I am building through my course. Keep checking back for updates.
</p>
<h6>Conveter from Miles to Km</h6>
<p>There definitely countable times when I felt lost in the middle of a conversation trying to convert in my head Km to Miles. This app is fast and easy. It allows the user to input
a value in Miles and convert it to Km and vice versa.

The code for this app is available on Github. The video below represents a simulation of how the app work.

<h5>Personal Website </h5>
<p>My motivation to make my personal website was to implement my knowledge of HTML and CSS more in depth. The website is currently still under construction. You can find the main page <a href="https://ldakir.github.io">here</a>.
The next step for my project would be to have a multipage website with a better design. I am also considering including a blog of pictures that I took of places I have traveled to.

<h5>HERA Microprocessor</h5>
<p>The HERA (Haverford Educational RISC Architecture) Microprocessor is composed of: ALSU (Arithmetic/Logic/Shift Unit), Operation control, Register file,
Program ROM, PC register and Flags handler. The user inputs HERA machine code and run a simulation. The microprocessor steps through each component depending on the machine code and outputs the values stored in the register file.
I implemented the HERA microprocessor in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LogisimLogisim">Logism</a>. The circuit is available <a href="https://github.com/ldakir/Logisim_circuits/blob/master/HERA_microprocessor.circ">here</a>.

<h5>Ising Model</h5>
<p> The Ising model allows to study the magnetization of a system using dipole moments of spins.
Each spin points either up or down depending on its magnetic moment. To observe the behavior of the Ising model within different systems,
I implement the Monte Carlo method in Python which relies on randomness to calculate the magnetization of a system.
The Monte Carlo simulation is computationally expensive. For each temperature, I iterate over 10000 steps to calculate the magnetization and the energy.
To make my code run faster, I tried to avoid unnecessarily re-calculating previously calculated values.
